# Enemy attack telegraphs: what the game has, what the data gives us (2026-09-01)

Grim Dawn has no telegraph system (no ground decals, cast bars or HUD markers for incoming attacks). What a
sighted player reads is the wind-up animation, a cast-start particle burst on some skills, the game's positional
sounds, and the persistent ground hazards (pools, clouds). All of it exists as data; this doc records the
mechanism (static RE + live capture through `src/casts.cpp`, dev route `/casts`) and the measured windows.

## The cast pipeline (verified live)
Every animated skill of every character runs, in this order:
1. `SkillActivated::StartAction(Character&, targetId, WorldVec3 target, uint, TargetLeadingData)` -- the
   animation starts. `Character::GetRemainingAnimationTime()` (ms) read right after it is the whole animation.
2. The animation's callback points fire through `Character::AnimationCallback(Name)` and, for the skill
   ones, `SkillManager::HandleSkillAnimationCallback(Name, uint slot, uint targetId, WorldVec3)` (`this` =
   Character+0x850; the `Character::` export of that name is a thunk the game never calls).
3. On a hit callback the skill's `HitAction(Character&, Name callback, targetId, WorldVec3)` runs, and the
   concrete class's `ActivateNow(...)` inside it does the geometry (wave, radius, projectile launch...).
4. `EndAction(Character&)` at the animation's `End` callback.

`GAME::Name` is a 32-bit **FNV-1a** digest of the string (case-sensitive; verified against RightHandHit /
LeftHandHit / R Footstep / End). The engine's callback vocabulary is fixed: the dispatcher compares against 34
strings, of which the hit names are `Hit`, `LeftHandHit`, `RightHandHit`, `FootHit`, `SpecialHit01..04`; the
rest are swipe on/off (weapon trails), PS1..3 Start/End (particles), SkillProp add/hide/remove, SkillSound1/2,
`SkillScript`, `End`. The shipped animations use only the first three hit names. Hit callbacks repeat freely
within one animation (max 5 in the shipped data: 121 of 967 hit-bearing animations are multi-hit), each
repetition is its own HitAction call.

Not through the pipeline: instant activations (`ActivateNow` called directly -- death explosions such as the
Burning Dead's `detonate.dbr` arrive with callback name `End`, area pools tick on their own, buffs) and the
Titan Quest-era boss controllers (Cerberus/Graeae/Megalesios/Ormenos/Terracotta, unused by GD content). Lua can
make a monster cast (`UseSkillAction`, still the pipeline) or kill outright; it has no damage call. Everything
still lands in `CombatManager::ApplyDamage` on the victim.

**Hooking rules learned the hard way** (the game exited silently at start, twice): Game.dll folds identical
bodies. `SkillActivated::HitAction` / `::ActivateNow` are one `ret` stub shared by 1,574 exports and
`::StartAction` a `xor al,al; ret` shared by 525 -- detouring them detours every empty virtual in the game.
`hooks.cpp attach_all` now refuses bare stubs and duplicate targets. Also folded: BuffSelf::StartAction ==
Suicide::StartAction; BuffOther/BuffSelf/Weapon/Suicide::HitAction are one vtable-redispatch thunk.

## Wind-up windows
Static (Creatures.arc .anm trailers: `CallbackPoint { name, frame }`, 30 fps, 1,770 files, 375 enemy
attack/special/cast animations with a hit callback), base rate before the monster's attack/cast speed
multiplier (1.0 for most, 0.75..1.4 across the bestiary):
- basic melee attacks (158): median 0.57 s, quarter under 0.43, 90 % under 1.0
- specials, stomps, slams (71): median 0.80 s, quarter over 1.03, slowest 1.87
- casts/spells (94): median 0.63 s, tail to 2.4 s (Loghorrean) and 2.9
- overall 3 % under 0.3 s, 27 % under 0.5 s, 77 % under 1.0 s; follow-up hits in a multi-hit land 0.15..1.0 s apart

Live (`/casts`, Lower Crossing, spawned monsters; first hit after StartAction, median):
- zombie basic 0.56 / 0.93 (two anims); Flesh Hulk basic 0.67; Warden basic 0.70; skeleton 0.70; rifthound 0.53
- gunman (ranged basic) 0.23, then projectile flight; dermapteran reaver 0.27; groble tracker 0.10
- Warden aether arc (wave) 0.53, aether wave 1.53, charge 0.55; Flesh Hulk aether smash (wave) 0.90, charge 0.06
- groble fireball (projectile) 1.05; vile brew 0.28; ice spike burst 0.31; wisp zap (tendril) 1.17 + 1.53 (2 hits)
- self buff 0.46; groble heal (buff other) 0.30
EndAction follows at 0.9..2.3 s. Ranges match the static numbers scaled by the monster's speed.

## The shape taxonomy (concrete `Skill_*` class of the skill object, readable live via RTTI)
Monster skill records by template (nonplayerskills, base game): attackwave 120, attackradius 114,
attackprojectileburst 100, attackweapon 93, attackprojectile 92, attackprojectilering 80, spawnpet 65,
attackprojectileareaeffect 64, monstergenerator 48, attackweaponcharge 38, attackspellchaos 14 (plus
passives/buffs). Geometry fields per template (`tools/arz.py`):
- **Melee swing** (WeaponPool basic, AttackWeapon, AttackWeaponCharge): reach = weapon, `skillTargetAngle`
  20..240 (charges 90), `skillTargetNumber` 1..6. A charge closes distance first (`characterRunSpeedModifier`).
- **Radius around the caster** (AttackRadius): `skillTargetRadius` 1..35, median 5; profile Melee/Short.
- **Directional wave** (AttackWave): `waveDistance` 8..16 (median 9), start width ~2.5 -> end width ~3 (up to
  18), `waveTime` ~1 s of travel. Caster facing matters.
- **Aimed projectile** (AttackProjectile, ProjectileBurst 1..6 shots, ProjectileRing 8..18 shots in all
  directions): flight time, `projectileExplosionRadius` 0.1..6 (median 2.5). Rings are "everywhere near".
- **Ground pool** (AttackProjectileAreaEffect): a projectile that leaves a `ProjectileAreaEffect` entity,
  radius 1.8..8 (median 3), `skillActiveDuration` 5..16 s (mostly 6..8). The Warden's ring: 3 u for 6 s.
- **Beam/tendril** (AttackSpellChaos): multi-hit line to the target, `Maximum` range.
- **Summon** (SpawnPet, MonsterGenerator; the Warden's aether trap is a summoned monster with a detonate
  AttackRadius).
- **Buffs** (BuffSelf*, GiveBonus, BuffRadius*): no threat geometry.

The Warden: 12 skills -- 4 passives, a rally, the aether trap summon, the aether ring (dying skill too), charge,
aether wave (8 u, 2->4 wide, 5 s cooldown), aether arc, aether zap (tendril).

## Dev
`/casts?lines=N` (cast/hit/end/instant lines), `/casts?cb=1` (every animation callback incl. footsteps),
`/casts?clear=1`. Spawn a monster at the character: `/lua?code=local p = Player.Get(<id>); local o =
Entity.Create('records/creatures/enemies/<x>.dbr'); o:SetCoords(p:GetCoords())` (Character.Create failed);
`p:ToggleInvincible(true)` first. Ranged AI needs 12+ u: spawn, then `/teleport` the character away.

## Built: the cue layer (2026-09-01, `src/telegraph.cpp`, fed by the StartAction hooks; verified firing live, not yet heard)
Five cues, one per reaction, from the skill object's concrete class (`telegraph::shape_of`): **swing** (weapon attacks,
charges, kicks -- get out of reach), **stomp** (AttackRadius -- step away from the caster), **wave** (AttackWave, spell
cones, line fans -- get off the line), **shot** (projectiles, bursts, spells, beams, pool launches, AND a weapon attack
started from more than 4.5 u = a ranged weapon -- sidestep), **ring** (ProjectileRing -- run outward). Buffs, summons,
moves and unknown classes are silent; pools are a hazard for the sonar/world layer, not a telegraph. Fires only for foes
(`world::is_foe`) within 25 u, once per caster per 80 ms (the weapon-pool wrapper and the basic attack both StartAction
in the same frame). Positioned with `world::ear_frame` + the rear shelf, no ramp yet.
The sounds are the five words spoken by Zira ("Microsoft Zira Desktop" through SAPI, the in-game positional voice),
silence-trimmed and time-compressed with ffmpeg `atempo` (pitch kept) to 200 ms (a 100 ms set was tried and dropped: too clipped to read), K-loudness-matched to the sonar's enemy cue:
`assets/audio/telegraphs/<shape>-<ms>.wav`, regenerated by `uv run tools/gen_telegraph_cues.py`.
Dev: `/telegraph?on=1|off=1&vol=&ms=100|200&test=<shape>` prints the recent cues and skip counters.
Player control: T in the world opens the announcement toggles (outgoing / incoming / telegraph cues), persisted in
settings.txt. Level: the files are K-loudness-matched to `units-enemy.wav` (-13.9 LKFS) and played above the master
volume on the voice rolloff (`world::voice_gain`); the first attempt (ping curve x master) was ~8 dB too quiet by ear.
Modes (2026-09-01): off / your target (`world::reviewed_id()` or the game's combat enemy) / highest tier (the caster's
MonsterClassification >= the top classification among enemies within 25 u, refreshed every 300 ms -- a trash pack
all speaks, a hero's adds do not) / all; plus a per-shape enable. Settings keys `telegraph.mode` (0..3) and
`telegraph.shape.<name>`. Dev: `/telegraph?mode=&shape=<name>,0|1`.
