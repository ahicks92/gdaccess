/// Builds a GraphRender. Two construction styles, freely mixable in one build:
///
/// **Menu mode** -- rows of controls, wired automatically: left/right within a row, up/down between
/// consecutive rows (two rows sharing a non-empty row key get column navigation -- up/down preserves
/// the position instead of snapping to the first item; ported from Tanglebeep's MenuBuilder, itself
/// from Factorio Access's menu.lua). Items added outside an explicit row become single-item rows (a
/// plain vertical menu).
///
/// **Raw mode** -- add_node() + connect() for arbitrary topologies.
///
/// Orthogonal to both: begin_stop() groups nodes into Tab-stops (arrows never cross a stop; Tab cycles
/// them), set_region() tags nodes with a region for Ctrl+arrow jumps, and the PARENT STACK builds the
/// presentation hierarchy: push_context() pushes a non-focusable structural level ("Difficulty
/// settings, list" -- announced when focus enters from outside), while begin_group() pushes a
/// focusable, EXPANDABLE group header (a tree section) whose children only emit while it's expanded --
/// expansion state lives in the persistent set the builder is constructed with (GraphState::expanded),
/// so screens hold no tree state of their own. Nesting recurses; a collapsed ancestor suppresses
/// everything beneath it.
///
/// Ownership note (C++ addition): every node the builder makes -- including the non-focusable context
/// parents that are never published -- is owned by the builder until build() hands the whole arena to
/// the render, which then owns it. Parent pointers therefore stay valid exactly as long as the render.
///
/// Misuse throws, as in the C#: std::invalid_argument for the ArgumentNullException/ArgumentException
/// cases, std::logic_error for the InvalidOperationException cases.
