// The data model of the UI navigation graph, ported from wotr-access (C#) src/UI/Graph/GraphTypes.cs.
// Engine-free by construction: nothing here knows a game type. Where the C# used `object` for a
// backing widget we use `const void*` (identity only); where it used Func/Action we use std::function.
//
// Nullable-string convention across this port: a C# `string` that could be null is a std::string here,
// and EMPTY means null. Every consumer in the C# tested it with string.IsNullOrEmpty (or compared it
// to another possibly-null string), so the two states were never distinguished. Nullable RETURN values
// of the announcer (compose/leaf_text/first_part_text) keep the distinction as std::optional<std::string>,
// because there "nothing to say" is the documented result the caller branches on.
